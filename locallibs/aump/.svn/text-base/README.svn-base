If you did not install 'aumfp-all', you must get pybm and install that
somewhere on your python path. We do not have setup.py files yet!

- http://code.google.com/p/pybm/
- svn checkout http://pybm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pybm

*
Do "chmod a+rx index.cgi" if you want to use this a web interface

*
Each of the microformat python files is runnable, giving as arguments
the files with HTML downloaded

*
Parse microformats like following:

parser = hcard.MicroformatHCard(page_uri = <uri_to_page>)
for d in parser.Iterate():
	... do stuff with 'd', the pythonic hcard ...

*
Having "tidy" on your path really helps

** We strongly suggest you build from CVS source if on Linux **

*
This version produces _tremendous_ amounts of logging. You may
want to modify GenericLog to ignore all non-exceptions.
